# Eyes Exercise

<img src="EyesScreenshot.jpg" alt="Eyes that move with the movement of your mouse">

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course.

This eyes program allows the user to move the eyes with the movement of the mouse. When you move your mouse around the screen, the eyes follow you!

It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How To Run

Download index.html, styles.css and eyes.js files by clicking the green code button. Make sure to save them to the same directory on your computer. Load the index.html file into your browser. Start moving your mouse across the screen to watch the eyes move. 

You can also interact with the page without having to download the files.
